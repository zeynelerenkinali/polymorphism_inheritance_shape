# Polymorphism & Inheritance: Shape Example

This repository demonstrates polymorphism and inheritance in object-oriented programming using a simple shape hierarchy.

---

## Features

- **Shape Base Class**: Defines common properties and methods.
- **Derived Classes**: `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` inherit from `Shape`.
- **Polymorphism**: Overridden methods to calculate area and perimeter for each shape.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zeynelerenkinali/polymorphism_inheritance_shape.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the example.
